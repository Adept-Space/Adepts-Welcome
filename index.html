<h1>Welcome Adepts!</h1>
<br><br><p>  It takes time to learn. It takes time to apply yourself. It takes help along the way. <br>
There are many times in life when we are left in the dark. Nobody seems to have all the answers.<br>
Our mission is to change that fact. When you need training to get into another technical field.<br>
When you have a project with mixed expertise and you don't know who to hire. <br>
When you just need to add a creative surge to your life with a new hobby.<br>
These are times when you will need us. <br> </p>
<p id="our-plan">Our plan is simple.<br>
 Build around the makerspace concept. Build it upwards into various technical fields.<br></p>
<p> Once established, we will push to grow, push to make new businesses possible.  </p>
